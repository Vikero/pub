## Introduction
This Excel workbook is meant for the content administration. Giving the user a partial control over the application.
The worksheets are used for the following:
* the Sankey translations
* the main modal: description text, image path, metadata and database hyperlinks
* the tutorial contents

## System access
The data is grouped and stored in worksheets.
 The worksheets name is not important, but the order is important. The worksheet ID is the index of the worksheet in the Excel workbook. The first worksheet has the ID 0, the second worksheet has the ID 1, etc. The worksheet ID is used in the script as a variable name. The user must assure that the worksheets order is never altered.
The data is linked to the worksheets in the following order:

1. modal (id 0)
2. indicators (id 1)
3. metadata (id 2)
4. datasets (id 3)
5. tutorial (id 4)

### Worksheets structure
The first row is always the header row, containing keys to access the data.

* the user must assure that the header row is never altered

The second row can be used as the optional info about the data.
* the sub-header row is purely informative and is not used in the script
* NB! Do not insert the sub-header row for the tutorial worksheet.

The data rows are used to store the data.
* the user can alter the data rows as needed (except the first column)
 
The first column is always the "primary key".
* The primary key is used in the script as a variable name. The user must assure that the primary key is never altered, missing and stays unique.

The user can rearrange the rows as needed, but the first row must always be the header row.

The user can rearrange the columns as needed, but the first column must always be the primary key.

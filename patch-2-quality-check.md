## Patch 2 - Data Quality Rules

14. Quality Checks:

- Upper limit for the miscellaneous partners
- Based on the country specific deviation value.
- The deviation value applies to the collecting country, not the partner country.

15. Similarity checks for the MSC

- Compare API_DEG and SULPH_PC of the miscellaneous partner to the partner country’s typical values.
- What is the data source is for typical data?
- Define the allowed deviation: This applies to the partner country, not the submitting country.
- Reporting should include code and name of the MSC.
- From what data source the name is coming?
- Given example is reporting also the matching partner code and name.

16. Partner UNK count check

- Check the ratio of UNK to total partners. The upper limit is 5%.
- Upper limit is same for all countries.

Below is a revised version of your rules with some grammar improvements and clarifications. I’ve also added some questions to help ensure everything is clear.
